    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p><b>Web development</b> refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as
        web
        design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that
        works over the internet i.e. websites. While web development typically refers to web markup and coding, website
        development includes all related development tasks, such as client-side scripting, server-side scripting, server
        and network security configuration, eCommerce development, and content management system (CMS) development.
    </p>
    <p>The Internet isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's become a portal and primary method of research, connection,
        education, and entertainment in the world. As of 2021, there were <strong>4.66 billion global</strong> Internet users — more than
        half the world's population.Given the rapidly-increasing number of Internet users, it's no surprise that web development is a rapidly
        expanding industry. Between now and 2030, the employment of web developers is expected to <strong>grow by 13%</strong>, much
        faster than most other technology careers.
